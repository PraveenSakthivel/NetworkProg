Runtime Numbers without system calls:
real	0m0.007s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.000s

Runtime Numbers with system calls:
real	0m0.109s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m0.108s

The program ran faster on several orders of magnitudes when not using system calls. This is because the library properly buffer their read system calls in order to ensure maximum efficiency. Whereas, my program would otherwise use a system call for each character which is much less efficient. As a result the program takes more time with the system calls flag.
